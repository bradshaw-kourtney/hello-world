# hello-world
## First repo.  Practice
I am using this platform to learn more about coding and data science.  Eventually I would like to use my knowledge of data science in the field of education.
Areas where I have experience
* Working directly in the classroom
* Using Stata to interpret data
* Statistics and economics classes in undergrad to apply relationships
